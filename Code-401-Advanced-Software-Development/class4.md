> - Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity. Objects get their variables and functions from classes. Classes are essentially a template to create your objects.

## Accessing Object Functions
> - To access a function inside of an object you use notation similar to accessing a variable

## Recursive Functions in Python
### What is Recursion?

> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly

### base condition in recursion
the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

## Maintaining State

> - When dealing with recursive functions, keep in mind that each recursive call has its own execution context, so to maintain state during recursion you have to either:

> - Thread the state through each recursive call so that the current state is part of the current callâ€™s execution context Keep the state in global scope
