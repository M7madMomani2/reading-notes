# Linked List
> - A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.
> - There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

## Why Linked List?
> - Arrays can be used to store linear data of similar types, but arrays have the following limitations.
> - The size of the arrays is fixed: So we must know the upper limit on the number of elements in advance. Also, generally, the allocated memory is equal to the upper limit irrespective of the usage.
> - Inserting a new element in an array of elements is expensive because the room has to be created for the new elements and to create room existing elements have to be shifted.
> - A linked list is created by using the node class. We create a Node object and create another class to use this ode object. We pass the appropriate values thorugh the node object to point to the next data elements. The below program creates the linked list with three data elements.
