## **terminology for a stack:**

> - **Push** Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
> - **Pop** Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
> - **Top** This is the top of the stack.
> - **Peek** When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
> - **IsEmpty** returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.


## **Stacks follow these concepts:**

> **FILO** ===>  First In Last Out ===> First Item added to all Last to Pop

> **LIFO** ===>  Last In First Out ===> Last Item added First to pop
