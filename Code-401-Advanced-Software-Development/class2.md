##  In Tests We Trust â€” TDD with Python
> - TDD means Test-driven development which means the kind of development were you stick lots of step by step tests called unit tests

> - Unit tests are some pieces of code to exercise the input, the output and the behaviour of your code. You can write them anytime you want.


> - The greatest advantage about TDD is to craft the software design first

> - Your code will be more reliable: after a change you can run your tests and be in peace

### What is Recursion

> The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly

### base condition in recursion

the solution to the base case is provided and the solution of the bigger problem is expressed in terms of smaller problems.

### particular problem is solved using recursion

represent a problem in smaller problems, and add conditions that stop the recursion.



### The difference between direct and indirect recursion

> - It is called direct when the function calls itself within it , And it is called indirect when the function calles another new functions that calls the same function again

> - The recursive program has greater space requirements than iterative program as all functions will remain in the stack until the base case is reached. 

> - Recursion provides a clean and simple way to write code.
