## conclusion
> - jQuery is a JavaScript file you include in your pages. 
> - Once included, it makes it faster and easier to write cross-browser JavaScript, based on two steps: 
  * Using CSS-style selectors to collect one or more nodes from the DOM tree. 
  * Using jQuery's built-in methods to work with the elements in that selection. 
> - jQuery's CSS-style selector syntax makes it easier to select elements to work with. It also has methods that  make it easier to traverse the DOM. 
> - jQuery makes it easier to handle events because the event methods work across all browsers. 
> - jQuery offers methods that make it quick and simple to achieve a range of tasks that JavaScript programmers commonly need to perform.
