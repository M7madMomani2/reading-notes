## **What Is a File?**
>  At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

## it consist of three main parts:

**Header:** metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)

**Data:** contents of the file as written by the creator or editor

**End of file (EOF):** special character that indicates the end of the file

## **Reading Files**

> These are the methods used in reading files
> - `.read(size=-1)` :  reads from the file based on the number of size bytes, if the value less than 0 or not entered it will read the whole file 
> - `.readline(size=-1)`: same as the above but for the lines 
> - `.readlines()` :  reads the rest of the lines and return them as a list 


## **Writing Files**

> These are the methods used in writing files
  > - `.write(string)`  :  This writes the string to the file. 
  > - `.writelines(seq)` :  This writes the sequence to the file. No line endings are appended to each sequence item. Itâ€™s up to you
