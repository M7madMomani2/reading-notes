* Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a process of deduction.
* If you understand execution contexts (which have two stages) ) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error in your code.
* To find the source of an error, it helps to know how scripts are processed.
* The console helps narrow down the area in which the error is located, so you can try to find the exact error.
* JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates
its own error object, which can tell you its line number and gives a description of the error.
* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements.
