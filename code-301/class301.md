## What Is Responsive Web Design? 
> Responsive web design is an overall approach to building websites that encompasses web specification standards and flexible design models. The philosophy behind it stems from the desire to make the web accessible to as many devices as possible.

> Responsive design ensures that a website displays properly on desktops and mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. This relatively simple idea has spawned an entire generation of frameworks and tools like Bootstrap that automate much of the grunt work involved in designing responsive sites.

## How Responsive Design Works?
> Responsive design enables us to optimize the presentation of a web page for many devices with a single piece of source code. This allows you to create similar experiences across different devices, or tailor a web page for a specific device.

## There are three main technical aspects of responsive web design:
- Fluid Grids
- Flexible Media
- Media Queries



## CSS Floats

floats create three flows

- Left
- Normal
- Right

Floats: Left and Right
Using floats can introduce up to two new flows: left and right.

And this allows the normal flow of elements, those without a float value, to fill in the spaces around these elements.

The Clear Property
“Clear” allows elements to specify where they should align in comparison to the floated elements.
