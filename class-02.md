## What is CSS ?

> Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document

## WHY CSS?
> - CSS saves time : You can write CSS once and reuse same sheet in multiple HTML pages.
> - Easy Maintainence : To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
> - Search Engines : CSS is considered as clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
> - Superior styles to HTML : CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
> - Offline Browsing : CSS can store web applications locally with the help of offline catche.Using of this we can view offline websites.

## let's find out some Data Types of JS and 
> - Numbers —> var age = 23
> - Variables —> var x
> - Text (strings) —> var a = "init"
> - Operations —> var b = 1 + 2 + 3
> - True or false statements —> var c = true
> - Constant numbers —> const PI = 3.14



## Comparison Operators

Operator | Description | Example
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(==)	| Equal to: true if the operands are equal	| 5==5; //true
(!=)	| Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal | 5!=5; //false
(===)	| Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type | 5==='5'; //false
(!==)	| Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	| 5!=='5'; //true
(>)	| Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand	3>2; //true
(>=)	| Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	| 3>=3; //true
(<)	| Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	| 3<2; //false
(<=)	| Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	| 2<=2; //true
