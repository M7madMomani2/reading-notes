> - ## Chart.js is a community maintained open-source library (it’s available on GitHub) that helps you easily visualize data using JavaScript. It’s similar to Chartist and Google Charts. It supports 8 different chart types (including bars, lines, & pies), and they’re all responsive. In other words, you set up your chart once, and Chart.js will do the heavy-lifting for you and make sure that it’s always legible (for example by removing some uncritical details if the chart gets smaller).
