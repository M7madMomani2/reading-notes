# Layout 
## CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to layout our web pages, but it’s never done a very good job of it. First, we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block. Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we’ve all been hacking our way around for as long as we’ve been making websites.


> - < div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
> - Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
> - The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
> - Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
> - Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
> - Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
> - CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
> - You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
