## let's find out some HTML  tags
> - The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
> - The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
> - The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
> - The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
> - The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
> - The < h 1 > element defines a large heading

## EXTRA MARKUP
> - DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
> - You can add comments to your code between the < !-- and -- > markers.
> - The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
> - The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
> - <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
> - The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
> - Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.


## HTML5 LAYOUT

> - The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
> - The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).
> - Older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements.
> - To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8 (and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed, which is available free from Google.


## PROCESS & Design

> - Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
> - Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
> - Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
> - You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
> - You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.

## Basic Operators of JS 
> - +— Addition
> - -— Subtraction
> - *— Multiplication
> - / — Division

## let's find out some Data Types of JS and 
> - Numbers —> var age = 23
> - Variables —> var x
> - Text (strings) —> var a = "init"
> - Operations —> var b = 1 + 2 + 3
> - True or false statements —> var c = true
> - Constant numbers —> const PI = 3.14



## Comparison Operators

Operator | Description | Example
------------ | ------------- | -------------
(==)	| Equal to: true if the operands are equal	| 5==5; //true
(!=)	| Not equal to: true if the operands are not equal | 5!=5; //false
(===)	| Strict equal to: true if the operands are equal and of the same type | 5==='5'; //false
(!==)	| Strict not equal to: true if the operands are equal but of different type or not equal at all	| 5!=='5'; //true
(>)	| Greater than: true if the left operand is greater than the right operand	3>2; //true
(>=)	| Greater than or equal to: true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand	| 3>=3; //true
(<)	| Less than: true if the left operand is less than the right operand	| 3<2; //false
(<=)	| Less than or equal to: true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand	| 2<=2; //true


## Loops: while and for

- for Loops Syntax: 
    - for(statement1; statement2; statment3)
    - {
    - lines of code to be executed
    - }
- while Loops Syntax
    - while(condition)
    - {
