# Document Object Model

## What is Document Object Model ?

> - The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 
> - The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.
> - DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.
> - You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.
> - Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadel i st.
> - From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
> - An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
> - In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
> - Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
