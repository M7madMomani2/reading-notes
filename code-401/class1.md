### Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. 

### Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

### Below are some common orders of growth along with descriptions and examples where possible.

> - O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time.
> - O(N) describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.
> - O(N2) represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.
> - O(2N) denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.

## Logarithms

> **Binary search** is a technique used to search sorted data sets.

It selects the middle value and goes towards the wanted value, Then do the same repeatedly till it finds the target
